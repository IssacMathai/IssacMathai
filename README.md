Hi, I'm Issac Mathai.

I’ve been programming in Python since 2018, so I feel the most comfortable with it. 

At university, I'm mainly programming in Java but also learning Typescript and Node.js.

In this GitHub you will find some projects of mine, most of which are from high school or university.
