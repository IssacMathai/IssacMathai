Hi, I'm Issac Mathai.

I’ve been programming in Python since 2018, so I feel the most comfortable with it.

I've used Terraform, C# and Kotlin in my past internships.

At university, I'm mainly programming in Python while also learning Rust.

In this GitHub you will find some personal projects of mine.
